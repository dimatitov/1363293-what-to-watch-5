        textReview: `The film is notable mainly for the personality of the protagonist: a mentally unhealthy rich man is already intriguing. DiCaprio, once again proving his professionalism, and successfully copes with this role - the look, facial expressions, speech, gestures form a very unpleasant type, so unlike a number of his charming characters. A solid group of notable actors - Blanchett, Beckinsale, Lowe, Baldwin, Defoe - even appearing sporadically, leave a good impression.`,

        textReview: `However, the movie is boring to watch. It seems more like a film essay, with strokes describing Hughes and his planes, cinema, women, oddities, than a biography - too fragmentary and messy. In addition, it is also unnecessarily tightened.`,

You know every live album, not just to the note - to every cry of the crowd. You've listened to all demos, all B-sides, all raw sessions, all bonus tracks. You know every video clip and every concert before the shot. It's not on vinyl or iTunes - inside your head.`,
